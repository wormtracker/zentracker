###Running the program within MATLAB:

* Requires all the files in this source code folder (see above).
* Requires assignmentoptimal.m from the package "[Functions for the rectangular assignment problem](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6543-functions-for-the-rectangular-assignment-problem)".
* Optionally can make use of the [mmread package](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8028-mmread).

The folders where the .m files are located must be included in the [Matlab path](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-search-path.html#br8cjwl-1).
